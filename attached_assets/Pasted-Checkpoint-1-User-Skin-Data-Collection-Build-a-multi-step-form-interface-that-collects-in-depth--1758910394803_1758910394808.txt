Checkpoint 1: User Skin Data Collection

Build a multi-step form interface that collects in-depth user skin data.

Each step contains only multiple-choice questions (radio buttons, dropdowns, checkboxes) for easy selection, covering:

Skin type (normal, oily, dry, combination, sensitive)

Specific skin concerns (acne, pigmentation, aging, dryness, redness, etc.)

Allergies or ingredient sensitivities (fragrance, parabens, sulfates, etc.)

Lifestyle factors impacting skin (sun exposure, pollution, diet)

Final step is an open-text form allowing users to freely write any additional concerns or info not covered in prior steps.

Store all collected data securely in the backend database keyed to each user.

Checkpoint 2: Ingredient Photo Upload & OCR Extraction

After submission, redirect user to a dashboard landing page with a prominent product ingredient photo upload screen.

Enable the user to take a photo of the ingredients label or upload from gallery.

Upon upload, call backend OCR service (Google ML Kit or equivalent) to extract ingredient text accurately.

Allow user to review and confirm extracted ingredient list before processing further.

Checkpoint 3: Ingredient Info Fetch via Custom Search API

Send the extracted ingredient list to backend.

Perform a well-crafted search query on your configured Google Programmable Search Engine (India-curated skincare ingredient sites) using Google Custom Search JSON API.

Aggregate top relevant result snippets and links referencing ingredient safety, benefits, or risks in Indian context.

Checkpoint 4: AI-powered Compatibility Analysis and Report Generation

Feed aggregated ingredient info along with the user’s skin profile data to AI (GPT or Google language model).

Use a precise prompt instructing the AI to classify each ingredient’s suitability into tags: Excellent, Good, Not Bad, Bad.

Request detailed, user-friendly explanations for each tag, supported explicitly by citing source website links as credibility.

Return this structured, annotated analysis back to frontend for display.

Checkpoint 5: History & Product Cards

Save the entire detailed product analysis in a user's history or profile section.

Display previous analyses as cards with:

Thumbnail image from product ingredient photo

Summary tags and analysis highlights

Links to original sources

Allow users to revisit, compare or delete past records in their history easily.

Additional Implementation Details
Ensure the multi-step forms use clear validations and progress indications.

Store all user data and analysis results securely complying with data privacy best practices.

Provide fallback instructions if OCR or search results are ambiguous or missing.

Optimize for mobile with a clean, responsive UI given Indian user demographics.

Consider localization in local languages based on target users (English, Hindi, Tamil etc.).

Use async background processing for OCR, search, and AI to keep frontend responsive.
